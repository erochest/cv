### Computer/Web Programming

#### Complete Life Cycle

Designed, implemented, and deployed an updated site for the Linguistic
Atlas Projects. This included transitioning to a RDBMS (MySQL) and new
web framework. In other situations, managed release process, including
overseeing scheduling of DBA, development, and client-facing
resources.

#### Code Quality

Focused on improving documentation, test coverage, and code quality
using unit tests, Js Test Driver, and Selenium.

#### Distributed Text Processing

Designed and wrote a simple Map/Reduce clone in Erlang to distribute
text processing over a small cluster of computers. Implemented a web
application in Python and Django to track the work and view the
results.

#### Team Work

Collaborated with teams using a variety of tools, including SVN,
Mercurial, bug tracking sites, and wikis. Worked with client-facing
and DBAs to improve specifications and develop sites.

#### Experience and Technologies

Have 10+ years experience writing Python programs for desktop
applications with Tkinter and wxWidgets and for web applications with
CGI, Django, and other frameworks. Have 6 years experience writing C#
programs for desktop applications with WinForms and for libraries to
be used in a variety of contexts. Developed web sites with HTML, CSS,
AJAX, ExtJS, and jQuery. Familiar with MySQL, MS-SQL, SQLite and other
databases. Comfortable on Windows and Linux/UNIX.

#### New Languages

Advancing skills in a variety of new languages, including Scala,
Clojure, and Haskell.

### Technical Writing

#### Communicating Complex Information in Computers and Linguistics

Trained lawyers, staff, and clients on the basics of computational and
corpus linguistics. Wrote a section of a whitepaper describing
computer search techniques. Maintained API documentation for a number
of software projects in Python and C#.

#### New Techniques

Wrote and recorded a screencast to help users navigate a complex
process on their computers.

### Computational/Corpus Linguisics

#### Information Extraction

Identified people, places, and times in document collections to
develop timelines for legal investigations, court preparations, and
electronic document discovery.

#### Statistical Analysis

Identified shifts in topics in a corpus of documents. Developed a
natural-language database interface using rule-based
grammars. Analyzed authors' stylistics. Collaborated with other
linguists, legal staff, and subject-matter experts to develop
customized electronic document discovery solutions.

#### Computational Lexicography

Designed and implemented a computer program to facilitate best
practices in writing and maintaining dictionary pronunciations.

#### Programming

Wrote programs analyzing text and language in Python, C#, PROLOG, and
other computer languages. Used hidden Markov models, support vector
machines, neural networks, and a variety of statistical tests.

### Education

#### Dissertation

Schwa: A Dictionary Pronunciation Database System
: Director: William A. Kretzschmar, Jr.
    Schwa implements a computer system for editing and managing
    dictionary pronunciations. This system emphasizes interoperability
    by using standard technologies such as XML and Unicode, and it
    includes an in-depth examination of the issues involved in
    producing lexicographical pronunciations, both from an historical,
    a technical, and a theoretical perspective. It also included
    complete documentation for the software described.

#### University of Georgia, Athens, GA

1995–2004, Ph.D., English

#### Southern Adventist University, Collegedale, TN
